# Application Health Check API

This API is used to check the health of the application. It returns the status 
of the application, based on various configured component health checks. This is
based on the draft RCF, ["Health Check Response Format for HTTP APIs"](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-inadarei-api-health-check)
